I had opened the starter codes in a new jupyter file but when I tried to remove the orginal starter files from my GitHub the message wouldn't dissapear (Revert "Codes") I tried removing the message through GitHub desktop 
and GitHub browser but I wasn't able to.
I had to watch the lectures from class 1 of NoSQL to remember how to import a json file and to make sure I was able to view it through Command text using mongoimport.
